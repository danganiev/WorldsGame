# Worlds
A video game where you create blocky worlds from scratch

I am now open sourcing the video game I tried to create but failed due to the project size being too big for one developer.

This is a minecraft-like voxel game with the difference that you have to create every block and item and 
block distribution formulas (perlin noise, etc.) yourself.
