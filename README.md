# Worlds
A video game where you create blocky worlds from scratch

I am now open sourcing the video game I tried to create but failed due to the project size being too big for one developer.

This is a minecraft-like voxel game with the difference that you have to create every block and item and 
block distribution formulas (perlin noise, etc.) yourself.

Example of what the game is capable of can be seen in this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn_ngTgInAU
